# Uberhaus Real Estate Website

This is a simple React web application for the hypothetical Uberhaus real estate agency. The site showcases available listings, services, and client testimonials.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be served at `http://localhost:3000` and reload on changes.

## Build and Test

- `npm run build` – creates an optimized production build under the `build` directory.
- `npm test` – runs the Jest test suite. No tests are currently included but the command is provided for future use.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App but the generic documentation has been trimmed for brevity.
